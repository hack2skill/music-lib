    lyrics: `[Verse 1]
    These roads intersect
    On each one I reflect
    These lines write my story
    These places change me
    Each one replacing
    Like night into morning
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    I miss the open air
    The going anywhere
    Riding with you
    Like we used to
    
    [Chorus]
    Guess I'm better off alone
    Never know when I'll get home
    But I know that home's where the heart is
    Guess I'm better off this way
    Moving to better days
    But I know that home's where the heart is

[Drop]
Home's where the heart is

[Verse 2]
The endless journey
I need no worry
I'll get where I'm going
I made it this far
Beyond where you are
And I'll keep on growing

[Pre-Chorus]
I miss the open air
The going anywhere
Riding with you
Like we used to

[Chorus]
Guess I'm better off alone
Never know when I'll get home
But I know that home's where the heart is
Guess I'm better off this way
Moving to better days
But I know that home's where the heart is
